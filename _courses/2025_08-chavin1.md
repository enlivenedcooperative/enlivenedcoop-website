# [New dates] Walking to Chavín: A regenerative pilgrimage of becoming and re-rooting in the Central Andes of Peru

{:toc}

## The calling

This is a call to participate on a pilgrimage of deepening and encounter in the central Andes of Peru, where the ancestral ceremonial center of Chavin de Huantar is located. 

Chavin (chawpin: ‘the center’) has been a point of encounter (‘tinkuy’) since 3000 years ago, where people from different places and paths would prepare and walk to reach this space of initiation, un/learning, exchange and transformation. The temple and its fascinating architecture is designed as a labyrinth palace dedicated to memory and interconnection of life forms and beings. 

This year, 2025, we will be re-activating the walking memory of this path, accompanied by the hirkakuna (guardian mountains), making offerings to the wankakuna (memory monoliths) and the vital bodies of water: rahukuna (snow capped mountains), mayukuna (rivers), quchakuna (lagoons) and to the tamya (rain). 

We will be weaving our force and breath, walking on the footsteps of the ancestors of deep visions dedicated to take care of life in the Andean-Amazonian ethical principle of ‘raise and be raised by’, conducting our bodies and essences in a naani (path) composed by infinite arrivals and departures, connecting to a deep, teluric and cosmic mystery.

This is an invitation to be present in an initiatic journey to meet the tsatsakuna (‘elders’) that dwell in the most intimate of our blood and bones, recognizing ourselves as part of a community of humans and non-humans, holding the responsibility, joy and wisdom of Buen Vivir, impregnated by the colors, textures and smells of the lands where we come from and those where we dwell.

- Be nourished by seasonal, local, natural and revitalizing food and participate in a profoundly transformative embodied practices. 

## In a nutshell

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/caminantas.jpeg)


Walking to Chavín: A pilgrimage through the Cordillera Blanca to the Chavín de Huántar ceremonial center is a 12-day experiential immersion in the Andean cosmovivencias (experiences and ways of being and knowing) and their ritual practices. Our journey on foot goes through an encounter with a millenary and sacred territory that invites us to recognize and manifest the immensity within us, in a sensitive and powerful dialogue with the beings and the memory that reside in the central Andes of Peru.

This proposal is designed to facilitate individual and collective deepening through the body. In addition to the guided walk along almost 40 km (25 mi) at altitudes between 3100 mt (10170 ft) and 4700 m (15419 ft) above sea level, the program includes conscious breathing and movement practices, sensitization and perception refinement exercises, offerings in the mountains, ceremonies with the sacred cactus of wachuma, word circles, intake of purifying and immunomodulating plants, orientation spaces, and ceremonial and guided encounters in the Chavin de Huantar temple. The gastronomic proposal is based on local, seasonal, traditional and healthy products and foods. This will also serve as a strategy to cleanse the senses, connect with the external space and prepare the body to receive the sacred plants and messages of the land.

We will start in the city of Huaraz, where we will have acclimatization walks, a conversation about Andean and Amazonian wisdom, about the relevance of Chavin and a session of connected and conscious breathing as part of the preparation for the journey from Olleros through the ravines and mountains of the Cordillera Blanca to the ancient town of Chavin de Huantar.
The team of companions will be formed by Renata Borges (Brazil), Elena Pardo (Peru), Ana Marica (Romania), Gerardo Amaro (Mexico) and Carlo Brescia (Peru), people with experience and knowledge in accompanying personal and group processes of transformation and liberation. Some of them are familiar to some of the indigenous cosmovisions of South America and Abya Yala, the ‘ripe land’ that Guna people gave to the Americas as a continent.

During the 4 days of trekking in the Cordillera Blanca, we will have the support of a specialized team, composed of Gladys Jiménez (Peru), trekking leader guide, together with Geonela Díaz (Peru), mountain expedition guide and cook, and three arrieros (muleteers), who will provide us with delicious food, orientation and good stories of the area. As grandfathers and grandmothers used to do in their time, we will walk with the support of llamas and donkeys that will carry our backpacks, freeing us to enjoy the trail without burdens. The second day in the mountain will be dedicated to offerings and acclimatization.

In Chavin de Huantar we will have a guided visit to the Chavin National Museum, times of rest and contemplation, and two sacred cactus ceremonies in the ancestral temple.

Throughout the days there will be circles of words and integration, where we will have the opportunity to decant our personal processes and share the learning of the path in a welcoming and supportive space. We will also have the option to hike to the Yurak Machay cave and relax our bodies in the Quercos hot springs, a 20 minute walk from the town of Chavin.

# Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.

During the hike from Olleros to Chavin, we will be accompanied by 5 people specialized in expeditions in the Cordillera Blanca: guide, cook and arrieros (donkey drivers).


## Cost

As a cooperative, we are trying new approaches to make the journeys affordable for as many people as possible while covering the costs and paying our faculty and hosts, as well as making generous donations to local regenerative projects. We are experimenting with a sliding scale in which you can choose the fee according to your life situation. 

**The suggested contribution for this yatra is based on a sliding scale from USD 2600 to USD 3500.**

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs

## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

![](/assets/img/courses/andes/laguna_patos.jpg)

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here. 


## Testimonials of past participants

"Our journey together was the most inspiring, fulfilling, satisfying, and enlivening trip I've ever taken... well, with the exception of being alive and somewhat conscious at this particular time in the Universe. Thank you for this extraordinary co-creation of Imagination, Possibility and Beyond"
Marianne

"Each person we met, each environment we engaged, was more astonishing than the last, making deep impressions on my consciousness about other ways of being. I carry these precious astonishments with me as I go".
Terri

## Reasons to participate

You have an interest in:

- Becoming present for the Earth in a mutually beneficial way.

- Delving into localized wisdom and scientific breakthroughs, exercising presence and exploring old new ways of relating to the web of life, including but not limited to our selves.

- Participating in, place-based, embodied, experiential learning that expands sensibilities and imagination.

- Cultivating spaces for other ways of knowing and being -aside from mainstream, disembodied, fragmented knowledge- which are highly relevant for the current challenges of our time.

## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.
