## The calling

Join us for an immersive journey through India’s sacred lands, where you’ll explore the power of regeneration and community-led change. Together with a group of activists, regenerative leaders and youth changemakers, we’ll honor the earth and co-create a path of ecological harmony, inspired by ancient wisdom and the vibrant colors of Holi.

Inspired by the spirit of Holi, delve into the essence of homemaking on this land and witness the weaving of new pathways—where the memory of the earth and the pulse of community converge to create a world rooted in love, joy, justice, and deep reverence for the land as our most sacred home. This is an invitation to journey into a deeper kinship with the earth, each other and ourselves - transforming our understanding of ‘home’. 


## Highlights

- Embark on a journey of homemaking, where we root ourselves in community, intertwine with the earth, and dwell deeply within.
- Engage with an inspiring ecosystem of community-led initiatives and grassroots organisations 
- Meet the organisations, the local initiatives, the spaces and the pathfinders whose work reawakens the complex ties between land and life.
- Wander through India’s sacred lands, where every taste, texture, colour and tradition tells a story of wonder and connection.
- Be nourished by seasonal, local, natural and revitalising food and participate in profoundly transformative embodied practices.
- Carve space and find inspiration and insights for your work and ideas
- Unlearn, journey within and regenerate your-self
- Celebrate Holi and, with it, joy of unity, forgiveness and the vibrant hues of life that connect us all


## The invitation

![](/assets/img/courses/india/trees-trail-Auroville.jpg){:.right.thumb width="350"}

In the ancient traditions of India, the yatra is a sacred pilgrimage. Attuned to that lineage, this yatra will prepare us to embrace the renewal of relationships. Over a two-week journey spanning more than 2,000 kilometers, we will travel through the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and the northwestern states of Gujarat and Rajasthan. Along the way, we will engage with a colorful constellation of grassroots organizations, exploring possibilities for homemaking and responses to the meta-crisis rooted in the Indic wisdom. 

Along the way, we will delve into the essence of homemaking on this land (and, through that encounter, also with our own lands): How do we anchor ourselves in community, entwine with the soil, and dwell deeply within our own being? What questions must we carry in our hearts to revere the Earth as our sacred sanctuary? Join us in unlearning and in co-creating a home not only within ourselves but also with the world around us—breathing life into a collective journey of becoming.
As we advance, we will immerse ourselves in the ecosystems we traverse, mapping the living webs of regeneration and deep ecological transformation unfolding across India. Throughout the two weeks, we will meet the organizations, the local initiatives, the spaces, and the pathfinders whose work reawakens the complex ties between land and life. Their efforts ripple through the fabric of capitalist modernity, ecological and social extractivism, and deeply rooted colonial practices—re-ecologizing the land with the rhythms of nature and honoring ancient wisdom as a compass for the future. In their efforts, we will witness the weaving of new pathways—where the memory of the earth and the pulse of community converge to create a world rooted in love, joy, justice, and deep reverence for the land as our most sacred home.

Just as Holi, the festival of colors, signifies the arrival of spring, the triumph of good over evil, and the renewal of relationships, our journey will invite us to step into a space of renewal and transformation. Rooted in mythology and diverse cultural traditions, Holi teaches us to celebrate the joy of unity, forgiveness, and the vibrant hues of life that connect us all.

This is an invitation to wander with wonder into the pluriverse of India’s sacred lands, to encounter that which is alluring—the tastes, textures, landscapes, languages, beliefs, and rites that call to the soul. Much like the colors of Holi that dissolve social barriers and invite all to dance together, we will weave deeper connections with ourselves, life, and consciousness.

## Itinerary

Dates: March 1 - 16, 2025

### Day 1. Saturday, March 1. Arrivals in Auroville, Tamil Nadu

From different corners of the world, our co-travellers are expected to arrive directly in Auroville. The closest international airport is Chennai - from there Auroville is 3 hours drive away. We invite everyone to reach ideally before 5:00 pm. We will gently kick-off our journey with a delicious dinner and an opening circle. 


### Days 2 & 3. Sunday & Monday, March 2 - 3. Exploring Auroville

![](/assets/img/courses/india/Auroville-temple-vertical.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

Auroville wants to be a universal town where people of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities. The purpose of Auroville is to realise human unity. 

We will start our journey in Auroville with a question of what it means to create a sense of home beyond our differences, and how can we as humans offer our gifts in the service of the larger life with intention and integrity. From connecting to the history and beauty of the land, to exploring multiple alternatives at the core of Auroville, you can expect to nourish your body, mind, heart and soul simply by being present, allowing yourself to arrive and connecting with your intent for the larger journey unfolding. 


### Day 4. Tuesday, March 4. Travelling to Kodaikanal

While we will be on the road for the entire day, we will also engage with the beauty of the land and its people at various stops. As we start very early in the morning from Auroville, we will stop at an incredible mangroves forest for a morning tour. Through a boat ride we will be able to learn from the locals about their tedious restoration work, and connect with the sacred significance of mangroves in the local ecology and culture. Then we’ll continue our travels until we reach Kodaikanal and our hosts for the evening.

### Days 5 & 6. Wednesday & Thursday, March 5 & 6. Exploring Kodaikanal 

![](/assets/img/courses/india/branches-and-rivers.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

Kodaikanal is a hill town in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It’s set in an area of granite cliffs, forested valleys, lakes, waterfalls and grassy hills. 

Here we will connect with the local farmers and their market, as well as explore a powerful vision for education coming from Sholai School - a space inspired by Jiddu Krishnamurti. Sholai School campus is spread over 35 acres amongst a coffee estate having fruit trees and pepper vines. We will go for a slow forest walk, connect with locals and tribals, visit a craft village and rethink the role of education. 


### Days 7 & 8. Friday & Saturday, March 7 & 8. Travel and exploring Valparai

![](/assets/img/courses/india/Valparai-hills.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

On March 7th we will leave early in the morning from Kodaikanal and start our journey towards Valparai, via the Chinnalapatti village. This place is inspired by Mahatma Gandhi’s vision for holistic development, self-reliance and self-sufficiency, as they have a community based model to production, from cotton to saree. We will connect with locals and learn from their craft and vision of the world. Then continue our road trip to Valparai. 

Home to tigers, panthers, elephants and macaques, Valparai is a hill station known for its vast tea estates. Once we reach, we will connect with nature conservation projects who are actively doing restoration projects rethinking the role of human development in such ecosystems. One deeper question we will hold together is that of the nature of interdependence between humans and other species. For example, understanding the human-elephants interactions, and what it means to travel from conflicts to coexistence in the Anamalai hills. 


#### Days 9 & 10. Sunday & Monday, March 9 & 10. Kotagiri

Continuing along the lines of tea estates, mist-cloaked hills and valleys and unspoilt beauty, we are going to travel to Kotagiri, in the heart of the Nilgiri hills, which have been the traditional home of the "Kota" tribes. The name 'Kota-giri' itself means 'mountains of the kotas'.

Here we will connect with people who are weaving between the Indic wisdom and the tribal ethos, working with indigenous communities on decolonization while reviving various aspects of ancient scriptures. You can expect to learn from local organisations around livelihood security for indigenous communities, food security and agriculture, land and community rights, socio-ecological wellbeing and more. 

On March 10th afternoon we will leave for Bangalore, where the Southern length of our journey will come to a closure. 

### Day 11. Tuesday, August 11. From South to North | Ahmedabad

![](/assets/img/courses/india/Ahmedabad-road.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

After a morning flight we will shift landscapes and reach Ahmedabad, where we will make our way through the hustle and bustle of the city until we reach the Environmental Sanitation Institute and the Gandhi Ashram. Ahmedabad will be all about connecting with Gandhi, Vinoba and their wisdom around embracing a plurality of religions, universal love and sense of service. Together, we will untangle the threads from conflict to non-violence, and from divide and disconnect to peace and gratitude. 

### Day 12. Wednesady, March 12. Ahmedabad to Vadodara

![](/assets/img/courses/india/Mumbai-street-food1.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

The last part of our journey before we start preparing for the Holi festival is dedicated to food systems, plate politics and rethinking healthcare. On our way from Ahmedabad to Vadodara we will stop for a nutritious meal and a farm tour in one of the most inspiring farms in Gujarat. From there, we will take another short drive to Vadodara, a city which is home to Nisargopachar Kendra Nature Cure Centre, also known as Vinoba’s ashram. The place itself is an invitation to rethink healthcare and our relationships with our bodies as pure wonders of nature. We’ll rest and spend the night in the ashram. 


### Day 13. Thursday, March 13. Preparing for Holi

![](/assets/img/courses/india/tree-and-huts.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

What better way to prepare for the festival of colours if not by connecting more deeply with the tribals and their wisdom? This day will find us at the Adivasi Academy, a place devoted to the study of Adivasi history, folklore, cultural geography, social dynamics, economy, development studies, medicine, music, arts and theatre. The campus of the Academy is situated on a beautiful 10 acre piece of land at the foot of the majestic Koraj Hill, full of craggy-rocks and entirely unpopulated. An archaeological site bearing prehistoric rock paintings, dating back to 10000 BC, and a mediaeval fortification belonging to the fifteenth century, within walking distance of the campus, give the location of the Academy a special feel of a heritage venue. We will spend our entire day connecting with the tribals and learning from their rich culture. 

### Days 14 & 15. Friday & Saturday, August 14 & 15. Village immersion & Holi Celebrations

![](/assets/img/courses/india/Holi-fire-2.jpeg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

Our journey leads us to a small village in Raiyana, Banswara, where we will experience the festival of Holi by sharing food, singing, dancing and celebrating with the locals through a deep village immersion. You will have the chance to experience Holi not just through the playful element of colours, but also by connecting with ancient rituals, participating in a tribal fair and learning more about the significance of this festival from elders. 

On 15th evening we will leave towards Udaipur where we will get ready to close our journey. 


### Day 16. Sunday, March 16. Udaipur

![](/assets/img/courses/india/Udaipur-edited.png){:.right.thumb width="350"}

Udaipur, also known as the City of Lakes, is filled with historic forts and palaces, museums, galleries, gardens, architectural temples, as well as traditional fairs and festivals. Here we will host a closing circle, and celebrate how far we’ve come through this wonderful yatra, alone and together. 

Udaipur is also one of the hubs of alternative education in the local ecosystem. If your learning appetite is still high, you can connect with local organisations focused on reimagining education. You are free to self-organise more days in Udaipur and the surroundings, depending on your overall availability. From Udaipur you can get train or flight connections to Delhi, Ahmedabad or Mumbai for your travels back home. 


# Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

Participants are invited to choose one topic of inquiry during their journey that is relevant and alive for them.

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.


## Languages

We will be using Hindi and English throughout our journey. Translations into Spanish, Portuguese, French, Romanian are available upon request. 


## Number of participants

As we aim to offer personalized support, we only have space for the participation of 12 people on this call.


## Financial contribution

As a cooperative, we are exploring new approaches to make the journeys accessible for as many people as possible while covering the logistical costs involved and honouring the contributions of our faculty, the projects hosting us and the team. 
To support this, we have adopted a sliding scale model - inviting you to choose a fee that reflects your life possibilities. 

The suggested contribution for this yatra is based on a sliding scale from EUR1900 to EUR3000.

## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and, sometimes, even co-create it. 

They are an interruption, a slowing down, many openings. 

They are brave passages to possibilities, invitations to go out of the familiar zone and expand our sensibilities to let ourselves be undone so that we can suspend the noise of the routine and be attuned to dreams, stories and practices that instigate a process of becoming guided by the calm whisper and the joyous dance of the Earth. 

Unlike tourism, this is not about consuming experiences, places, or people. 

It is about engaging with the land and her guardians (human, non-human, more-than-human). 

It is about activating the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different -tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being- with curiosity and respect. 

The journey is simultaneously a retreat, a ceremony and a ritual that embraces the unknown as a fertile soil for radicalizing imagination and a pathway to deepen the relations to self, life, consciousness and the many worlds that constitute the pluriverse. 

![](/assets/img/courses/india/biohut.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

## Who is this for?

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here. 


## Reasons to participate

You have an interest in:

- Becoming present for the Earth in a mutually beneficial way.

- Delving into localized wisdom and scientific breakthroughs, exercising presence and exploring old new ways of relating to the web of life, including but not limited to our selves.

- Participating in, place-based, embodied, experiential learning that expands sensibilities and imagination.

- Cultivating spaces for other ways of knowing and being -aside from mainstream, disembodied, fragmented knowledge- which are highly relevant for the current challenges of our time.

- Unfolding a self and collective inquiry leading to the birth of new practices and stories.

- Co-creating a space for deepening artistic explorations.

- Meeting fellow travelers with similar interests and mutual inspiration .

## Ethics and economy

As a cooperative, we believe in offering programs that help you, your community and the world be enlivened again. We strive to co-create regenerative livelihoods for our families and for the planet. We refuse to engage in deadlihoods and we engage in initiatives that support alivelihoods, regenerating ourselves, the earth’s natural systems and local healthy families and communities.

By participating in this journey, you support an effort to engage with equity and social and environmental justice, supporting localized circular economies, exploring more regenerative economic practices, helping a democratically run cooperative, and enhancing the practice of being a grateful guest of Earth.
