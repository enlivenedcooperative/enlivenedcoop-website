# Re-created by Sound: Refining the art of listening in Morocco

## The invitation

This is a pilgrimage to the sanctuary of listening, a deepening of how we are present to hear the voices of those who fight for the dignity of life, and an invitation to open ourselves to the colors and constellations of sounds spoken by rivers, clouds, mountains, seas, and stars. Every antenna must be tuned to process the correct frequency. In this sense, this journey is a practice of tuning into life.

During two weeks we will travel through various landscapes of Moroccan geography: near Merzouga Ouarzazate, our feet will feel the fine caress of the sand and the majestic silence of the desert; in the Atlas Mountains, we will follow the routes of transhumance, tracing the footsteps of shepherds and memory; we will be captivated by the abundance of paths and stories found in the market of Djeema el-Fna square in Marrakesh; and we will be moved by the liberating notes of Gnaoua and world music in Essaouira.
On this pilgrimage to the heart of sound, we will explore different inner landscapes: trembling with the touch of a loving word, marveling at the cochlea's delicate response to air pressure, remembering the cosmic hum of primordial radiation, listening with our whole body, accepting the invitation of indigenous languages ​​such as Yucatecan Maya, in which no distinction is made between hearing and feeling, both expressed by the same verb: u’uy.

## What is an un/learning journey?

![](/assets/img/courses/General journeys photos/banner-Peru-panorama-terraces-group.jpg)

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and co-create it. 

This is a transformative experience focused on attuning the senses to possibilities and engaging deeply with new perspectives. It invites participants to release assumptions, connect with the land and her guardians and activate the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different (tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being) through curiosity and respect. It is an invitation to immerse oneself in a shared process of becoming—nurturing imagination, self-awareness, and meaningful connections with the world. 

The practices proposed by the host team are ways of approaching and integrating the journey we will experience in the two dimensions of landscapes, both external and internal. When we come into contact with that which is different—language, food, climate, stories, time, rhythms—our senses are awakened, our ideas are re-created, and in the process, we are transformed. The journey offers support for this transformation through a variety of practices: meetings with local communities and leaders, meditations, word circles, yoga, somatic dance, sacred reading of secular texts, dream plenaries, and others that may arise through co-creation.

## Who is this for?

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/Huasteca_group_walking1.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here. 


## Itinerary

Dates: June 18 - 30, 2025

### Wednesday, June 18: Echoes of arrival

In Skoura, we arrive from different paths, converging as strangers and companions. This is a day to settle, to meet one another, and to begin weaving the threads of connection that will guide our journey ahead. 


### Thursday, June 19: The Caravan’s Murmur

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/Peru-journey-group-opening.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

Under the Skoura sun we gather for the first time as a circle - hearts opening, ears attuned — to hear the collective voice of our journey. Here, we pause to settle into the rhythm of the journey, listening to the whispers of arrival. 

### Friday, June 20: The Solstice’s Embrace

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/Morocco-palm-trees.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

Morning brings a gentle walk through Skoura’s verdant palmeraie or the winding paths of the Dadès Gorge, where the land murmurs its timeless stories. By afternoon, we journey to Merzouga, tracing the routes of the Amazigh caravans under the Solstice sun. In the evening we will take a moment to honor the sun's peak and the balance between light and shadow, guiding us into deeper attunement with cosmic cycles. 

### Saturday, June 21: The Song of the Dunes

The day unfolds in Merzouga, where we engage in the timeless crafts of the Amazigh people - pottery, and weaving - practices that echo their deep bond with the land. 
At sunset, we venture into the dunes on camelback, setting camp in the desert. Beneath the sky, stories and silence intertwine and will let stars and stories sing us to sleep.

### Sunday, June 22: Sunrise Reverie

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/merzouga-desert-sunrise.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

We rise with the desert sun, its warmth mirroring the Amazigh spirit of resilience. Returning to Merzouga, we travel onward to Tamnougalt, where history is etched in every Kasbah wall. Visiting the Berber Museum, we listen to the echoes of a culture that has lived in harmony with this land for centuries, their music a vibrant thread in the fabric of time.

### Monday, June 23: Pathways of Resonance

Morning in Tamnougalt invites us to savor its serenity before the road leads us to Setti Fatma. 
Crossing the landscapes of the Atlas, we are guided by the enduring presence of the Amazigh people, whose intimate knowledge of these mountains teaches us to walk gently and listen deeply.

### Tuesday, June 24: Restful Harmonics

A day of stillness in Setti Fatma, where hammams cleanse, treks beckon, and the land reminds us of the balance between movement and pause—a rest note in the song of travel.



### Wednesday, June 25: Threads of Connection

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/Marrakech-market2.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

Arriving in Marrakech, the city’s vibrant energy stirs us - a pluriverse of colors, sounds, and scents weaving tradition with modernity. Wandering through the medina, we encounter artisans and conversations that reveal stories of resilience, art, and activism, offering a glimpse of the wisdom to come.



### Thursday, June 26: The Weave of Voices

Still in Marrakech, we are invited to witness creativity as a powerful catalyst for change through the work of local artists and cultural spaces. A nearby initiative amplifies the call for empowerment, reminding us of the enduring strength of the human voice.





### Friday, June 27: Rhythms of the Ocean

The journey flows to Essaouira, where the Gnaoua & World Music Festival greets us with its powerful harmonies—ancient beats blending with modern crescendos.

### Saturday, June 28: Resonant Frequencies

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/Gnawa-player.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

Immersed in the festival’s second day, we feel music’s ability to connect and heal, a universal language weaving through time and place.




### Sunday, June 29: The Closing Note

A day for reflection and integration in Essaouira. As the waves whisper their song, we honor the land and the journey with a closing ceremony, letting gratitude rise along with the tide.




### Monday, June 30: Farewell Cadence

Departures carry the echoes of all we’ve heard, felt, and seen. As we part, the land’s wisdom lingers — a rhythm we'll now carry within.

## Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.


## Cost

As a cooperative, we are exploring new approaches to make the journeys accessible for as many people as possible while covering the logistical costs involved and honouring the contributions of our faculty, the projects hosting us and the team. 
To support this, we have adopted a sliding scale model - inviting you to choose a fee that reflects your life possibilities. 

**The suggested contribution for this yatra is based on a sliding scale from EUR 1600 to EUR 2500.**

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs
- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time
- have investments, retirement accounts, or inherited money
- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in
- have a relatively high degree of earning power due to level of education (or gender and racial privilege, class background, etc.)

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- have difficulty covering basic expenses
- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

((This model is inspired by our friends at Re-imagine Education and is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com))

If you select an amount at the higher end of the scale, you will make possible future offerings and support the good work of the speakers, facilitators, and organizers who are generously contributing their gifts to this event. You will also be contributing to the partial grants fund for those needing financial support.

We require a non-refundable deposit of EUR 500 to book your spot.

## Faculty and team:

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/Faculty-Hajar.png){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Hajar Tazi**, Storyteller and ecosystem weaver in the field of regenerative development and education from Morocco. Drawing inspiration from the way natural ecosystems flourish, Hajar cross-pollinates amongst regenerative projects and organizations and spreads the mycelium of radical collaboration in service to the full round of Life. Inspired by indigenous cosmovisions and spiritual ecology, Hajar is on a journey of reclaiming and uncovering ancient and new ways of belonging to the Earth. She nurtures the soil of reverence and deep relationality with self, others, and nature to support the blossoming of life-sustaining ways of being, thinking, and relating, paving the way for the Symbiocene.

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/Wangui.PNG){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Wangũi wa Kamonji**, regeneration practitioner researching and translating indigenous Afrikan knowledges into experiential processes, art and honey to provide rooted embodied tools for us to decolonise and reindigenise.

Wangũi weaves research using academic and indigenous methods; storytelling in written and oral forms; traditional Afrikan dance and movement practice; ancestral connection, processwork, and nervous system relation in her work with the organism fromtheroots, which supports individuals’ and communities’ transitions from coloniality to the pluriverse through transformational un/learning, coaching and practice accompaniment. Her work is motivated by the twin challenge of healing the colonial traumas of past and present, and (re)creating ways for us to live regeneratively with ourselves, Earth and ancestors again, and responds to an ancestral invitation to rethink and reimagine everything from indigenous Afrikan ontologies.


![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/ana-portrait.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}



**Ana Marica**, community weaver, facilitator and learning designer exploring the ways knowledge is woven across communities, cultures, ecologies, and ways of being. Currently she is navigating learning at the intersections of geographies and worlds, designing unlearning journeys that invite individuals and communities to question, reimagine, and transform. 
Based in Bucharest, Romania, Ana moves between territories - both on land and underwater - seeking the wisdom held in diverse ecosystems and communities.  


![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/gerardo.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking  the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood.
