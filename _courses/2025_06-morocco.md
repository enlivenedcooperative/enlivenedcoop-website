# Re-created by Sound: Refining the art of listening in Morocco

## The invitation

This is a pilgrimage to the sanctuary of listening, a deepening of how we are present to hear the voices of those who fight for the dignity of life, and an invitation to open ourselves to the colors and constellations of sounds spoken by rivers, clouds, mountains, seas, and stars. Every antenna must be tuned to process the correct frequency. In this sense, this journey is a practice of tuning into life.

During two weeks we will travel through various landscapes of Moroccan geography: near Merzouga Ouarzazate, our feet will feel the fine caress of the sand and the majestic silence of the desert; in the Atlas Mountains, we will follow the routes of transhumance, tracing the footsteps of shepherds and memory; we will be captivated by the abundance of paths and stories found in the market of Djeema el-Fna square in Marrakesh; and we will be moved by the liberating notes of Gnaoua and world music in Essaouira.
On this pilgrimage to the heart of sound, we will explore different inner landscapes: trembling with the touch of a loving word, marveling at the cochlea's delicate response to air pressure, remembering the cosmic hum of primordial radiation, listening with our whole body, accepting the invitation of indigenous languages ​​such as Yucatecan Maya, in which no distinction is made between hearing and feeling, both expressed by the same verb: u’uy.

## What is an un/learning journey?

The raw material of an un/learning journey is time. With care, we curate, knead, craft and co-create it. 

This is a transformative experience focused on attuning the senses to possibilities and engaging deeply with new perspectives. It invites participants to release assumptions, connect with the land and her guardians and activate the memory that walks to the encounter of what is different (tastes, landscapes, textures, languages, rhythms, ways of knowing, modes of being) through curiosity and respect. It is an invitation to immerse oneself in a shared process of becoming—nurturing imagination, self-awareness, and meaningful connections with the world. 

The practices proposed by the host team are ways of approaching and integrating the journey we will experience in the two dimensions of landscapes, both external and internal. When we come into contact with that which is different—language, food, climate, stories, time, rhythms—our senses are awakened, our ideas are re-created, and in the process, we are transformed. The journey offers support for this transformation through a variety of practices: meetings with local communities and leaders, meditations, word circles, yoga, somatic dance, sacred reading of secular texts, dream plenaries, and others that may arise through co-creation.

## Who is this for?

![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/Huasteca_group_walking1.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

The journeys are for those willing to participate in the co-creation of different stories, dreams and practices, for those searching to expand their horizons and attune their sensibilities and desires, for those daring to entertain an open mind and heart, holding contradictions with authenticity and making space for questions rather than answers. They are for those willing to explore who they really are and how to become present for the Earth in a mutually enhancing way.

We strongly encourage to apply for the program to everyone who feels called to join, especially to people of all ages with a serious commitment to re-inventing their relationship to Earth and to self, activists, artists, scientists, students, unschoolers, therapists, educators, farmers, community organizers, magicians, dropouts, writers, workers, and everyone resonating with the invitation to be present with the other worlds that are possible and that are already here. 


## Itinerary

Dates: June 18 - 30, 2025

### Wednesday, June 18: Echoes of arrival

In Marrakesh, we arrive from different paths, converging as strangers and companions. This is a day to settle, to meet one another, and to begin weaving the threads of connection that will guide our journey ahead. 


### Thursday, June 19: The Caravan’s Murmur

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/Peru-journey-group-opening.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

On the road to Skoura, the desert begins to hum its ancient tune. In the afternoon, we gather for the first time as a circle - hearts opening, ears attuned — to hear the collective voice of our journey. Here, we pause to settle into the rhythm of the journey, listening to the whispers of arrival. 

### Friday, June 20: The Solstice’s Embrace

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/Morocco-palm-trees.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

Morning brings a gentle walk through Skoura’s verdant palmeraie or the winding paths of the Dadès Gorge, where the land murmurs its timeless stories. By afternoon, we journey to Merzouga, tracing the routes of the Amazigh caravans under the Solstice sun. In the evening we will take a moment to honor the sun's peak and the balance between light and shadow, guiding us into deeper attunement with cosmic cycles. 

### Saturday, June 21: The Song of the Dunes

The day unfolds in Merzouga, where we engage in the timeless crafts of the Amazigh people - pottery, and weaving - practices that echo their deep bond with the land. 
At sunset, we venture into the dunes on camelback, setting camp in the desert. Beneath the sky, stories and silence intertwine and will let stars and stories sing us to sleep.

### Sunday, June 22: Sunrise Reverie

![](/assets/img/courses/morocco1/merzouga-desert-sunrise.jpg){:.right.thumb width="270"}

We rise with the desert sun, its warmth mirroring the Amazigh spirit of resilience. Returning to Merzouga, we travel onward to Tamnougalt, where history is etched in every Kasbah wall. Visiting the Berber Museum, we listen to the echoes of a culture that has lived in harmony with this land for centuries, their music a vibrant thread in the fabric of time.

### Monday, June 23: Pathways of Resonance

Morning in Tamnougalt invites us to savor its serenity before the road leads us to Ouirgane. 
Crossing the landscapes of the Atlas, we are guided by the enduring presence of the Amazigh people, whose intimate knowledge of these mountains teaches us to walk gently and listen deeply.

### Tuesday, June 24: Restful Harmonics

A day of stillness in Ouirgane, where hammams cleanse, treks beckon, and the land reminds us of the balance between movement and pause—a rest note in the song of travel.

### Wednesday, June 25: Threads of Connection

Back to Marrakesh, the city’s vibrant energy stirs us. It’s a brief interlude before diving into the layers of art, activism, and ancestral wisdom awaiting us while getting lost in awe and wonder through the streets of the Djma el Fnaa market. 

### Thursday, June 26: The Weave of Voices

The Queens Collective and Musée de la Femme invite us to listen to the power of creativity as a vessel for change. Project Soar echoes a call for empowerment, a reminder of the human voice’s strength.

### Friday, June 27: Rhythms of the Ocean

The journey flows to Essaouira, where the Gnaoua & World Music Festival greets us with its powerful harmonies—ancient beats blending with modern crescendos.


### Saturday, June 28: Resonant Frequencies

Immersed in the festival’s second day, we feel music’s ability to connect and heal, a universal language weaving through time and place.

A day for reflection and integration in Essaouira. As the waves whisper their eternal rhythm, we honor the land and the journey with a closing ceremony, letting gratitude rise like the tide.

### Monday, June 30: Farewell Cadence

Departures carry the echoes of all we’ve heard, felt, and seen. As we part, the land’s wisdom lingers—a melody we now carry within.

## Ecopedagogy and travelling

Before, during and after the journey we exercise a cosmopolitical pedagogy of emergence (COPE). We understand cosmopolitics as an exercise of ‘slowing down reasoning’ (Stengers) that creates an opening for possible articulations between worlds. In this sense, it is a pedagogy of encounter, of sourcing inner wisdom, of dialogue between cultures and world-making practices, one that involves movement, story, dreams, inquiries, solidarities, boundaries and practices that allow for the uniqueness of the process of coming into being, of a becoming that invites a new relationship of the human within an entangled, endangered yet potent web of life. 

During the journey, we will have a combination of visits, group process sessions, lectures, practices and free time. Participants are invited to document their journey in the way that suits them better for their learning process.


## Cost

As a cooperative, we are exploring new approaches to make the journeys accessible for as many people as possible while covering the logistical costs involved and honouring the contributions of our faculty, the projects hosting us and the team. 
To support this, we have adopted a sliding scale model - inviting you to choose a fee that reflects your life possibilities. 

**The suggested contribution for this yatra is based on a sliding scale from USD 2000 to USD 3000.**

Consider contributing MORE on the scale if you:

- have the ability to comfortably meet all of your basic needs
- belong to a sponsoring organization or are employed full-time
- have investments, retirement accounts, or inherited money
- travel recreationally
- have access to family money and resources in times of need
- work part-time by choice
- own the home you live in
- have a relatively high degree of earning power due to level of education (or gender and racial privilege, class background, etc.)

Consider contributing LESS on the scale if you.

- have difficulty covering basic expenses
- are supporting children or have other dependents
- have significant debt
- have medical expenses not covered by insurance
- are an elder with limited financial support
- are an unpaid community organizer
- have unstable housing and/or limited access to reliable transportation
- have not taken a vacation or time off due to the financial burden

((This model is inspired by our friends at Re-imagine Education and is based on the ‘Green Bottle’ sliding scale model by Alexis J. Cunningfolk | www.wortsandcunning.com)

If you select an amount at the higher end of the scale, you will make possible future offerings and support the good work of the speakers, facilitators, and organizers who are generously contributing their gifts to this event. You will also be contributing to the partial grants fund for those needing financial support.

We require a non-refundable deposit of $500 USD to book your spot.

**Ana Marica**, Romanian community weaver, facilitator and learning designer exploring the rich tapestry of cultures around the world. On a mission to understand how communities can change for the better when self-directed learning principles are introduced in the educational process, she has spent the last 8 years researching and connecting with projects and communities from around the world who actively contribute to reimagining learning paradigms.

During this time, she has co-founded Digital Romads, a learning and organizational design consultancy whose purpose is to support communities and organizations explore transparent, open, self-managed, and co-created ways of collaborating and communicating. 
Currently based in Bucharest, Romania - her basecamp in between travels and explorations of various territories (both at surface and underwater).  


![](/assets/img/courses/huaesteca/gerardo.jpg){:.right.thumb width="250"}

**Gerardo López-Amaro**, co-founder of the Enlivened Cooperative, is currently walking  the path of autonomous education with the task of imagining spaces of encounter for thinking-feeling together about ways to strengthen the defense of life, memory and territory. He sees this as part of a planetary struggle for cognitive, relational and ontological justice. He is purposefully becoming entangled in a great “we” of people enacting the pluriverse, that “world where many worlds fit.” Born and raised in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, he’s a pilgrim of viable spaces informed by politics of love and consciousness regarding the healing of land and territory, love and intimacy, and labor and livelihood.
